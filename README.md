NC - BREAKING NEWS
Hello please take a look at my first react app.
This app has been designed as an news app where users can interact with the interface by posting comments.

About this App
I can created this app using my Back-End API that I created using PostgreSQL, Express.JS, Jest, Husky, JS.
This app displays articles fetched from my API with the ability to sort articles by votes or date on the homepage. You can click on an article to see it on a single page view. Users can leave votes for the best comments. Comments can be posted and deleted by users too!

During the build of this app I have familarised myself with the following react hooks:

useState
useEffect
useParams
React Routing
Optimistic Rendering
Composition in React

What API did you use?
